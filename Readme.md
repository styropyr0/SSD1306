Beginner and nerd friendly OLED Display library for Arduino, ESP and other MCUs. 

Nerds could take the full control of the device using manualSetup() function. For auto setup, use the autoSetup() function.

Features

1. 15 different progress bars. 10 are progress bars and 5 are loaders.

2. Supports external fonts.

3. Intelligent enough to not trim characters at the edges. If a character cannot be fully displayed, it will be displayed on the next line, preventing overflow and no need to manually use newline escape character.

4. Tables

5. Scroll views 

6. Supports other languages (Need to use an external font set and map them)
